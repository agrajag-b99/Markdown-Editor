This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) Markdown editor project which lets you edit and store files to an AWS S3 bucket

## Setup

Create a '.env.local' file to give your aws credentials

Go and set the name of the bucket in **pages/api/upload.js** line number 2.

## Setup In production

While deploying this app you'll have to give the new endpoint of **upload** api in **pages/index.js** line number 27

## Getting Started

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
